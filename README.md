WP Realm
========

WP Realm is a soon to be launched blog concerning all things WordPress. The main purpose behind WP Realm and general focus will be non-commercial community blog which will focus on all WordPress business/blogs/people etc. No just centric around the US community. No doubt the occasional American may appear but itâ€™s aim is to be more balanced, to keep people up-to-date on non-US news and to promote non-US WP businesses.
