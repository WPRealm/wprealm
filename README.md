WP Realm
========
WP Realm is a blog concerning all things WordPress. This is a non-commercial community blog, focusing on the WordPress community worldwide, and redressing a current imbalance in WordPress blogs that are too often US-centric. That means reporting on WordPress news and events across the world, from France to Serbia to China to India to South Africa to the USA and everywhere in between! Our focus is on WordPress businesses, blogs, events, people and services. As a community project, we’d love for you to get involved, whether it’s helping with the design and development, to reporting the news, to writing an editorial, or just giving us your feedback.

WP Realm is published in English, but we invite contributions from anyone, no matter what your first language is. Articles don’t need to be in perfect English as everything will be edited before being published. Follow the project or get in touch to get involved.

Where are you at?
-----------------

You can already find us at [http://wprealm.com](http://wprealm.com) where we'll continue to build the site for all to see and follow.

WP Realm Theme
--------------
You will find the development of the Theme for WP Realm right here in this repo. Meaning, if you will like contributing in any way shape or form we strongly encourage you to do so. Yes, just like any other open-source project.
